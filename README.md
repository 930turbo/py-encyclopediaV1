This is a simple (and somewhat messy) encyclopedia I created to test different ways I could implement both PYGAME and TKINTER

You will need to install both Pygame and Tkinter for this project to run

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to message me at giancarlo@northboropcs.com
